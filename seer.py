      Discharge Summary
      Patient Information:
      Name: John Doe
      DOB: January 15, 1975
      MRN: 123456789
      Medical History:
      The patient, John Doe, presented with symptoms consistent with a respiratory infection, including persistent cough, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever.

      Diagnosis:
      ICD-10 Code: J18.9 (Community-acquired pneumonia, unspecified organism)
      Laboratory results revealed an elevated white blood cell count, and chest X-ray showed infiltrates.
      Treatment:
      The patient was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (ICD-10 Code: J18.9) and was treated with the following medications:

      Antibiotics: Prescribed a course of antibiotics for bacterial infection.
      Supportive Care: Received supportive care to manage symptoms.
      Complications and Additional Diagnosis:
      During the hospital stay, there was concern for possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to leg swelling and pain.

      ICD-10 Code: I82.409 (Deep vein thrombosis of unspecified lower extremity)
      Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated.

      Other Medical Considerations:
      Additionally, the patient had a history of hypertension and was monitored closely for any cardiac complications.

      Discharge Information:
      The patient is discharged with the following medications:

      Antibiotics : Complete the prescribed course.
      Anticoagulation Therapy : Continue as prescribed.
      Follow-up appointments are scheduled for continued care and monitoring.
