# S.E.E.R: System for Efficient Encoding and Reference

S.E.E.R is implemented as a web-based application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications.

It leverages MedSpaCy, a specialized medical text processing library, to analyze input medical documents and extract relevant ICD10 codes. The application provides users with a user-friendly interface to input medical text, search for specific terms, and generate ICD10 codes. It utilizes MedSpaCy's capabilities to highlight code-related content in the original text, ensuring accuracy and clarity.
